Assignment 9 - Scrabble Write Up

I was able to pretty much implement what was required. The only real exception
being the letter distribution is a bit off. It saves a lot of the tiles with the
most instances for last.

I restricted the user from being able to directly move tiles once they were on the board
so that those pieces could look much neater. The tiles get hidden and the board pieces 
contain an image and paragraphm it made it easier to keep track of the tile data.

There are four buttons. submit word which submits the word, generates new tiles for those used
and adds up the score. Refresh tiles which gives the user a new set of tiles, the old ones get 
added back to the tile array and are unhhidden, essentiall put back in the original place. 
Reset tiles which removes any data from the board and unhides used tiles. And calculate word
score which does as it says, but does not get submitted for a new round.

I opted to force the player to use the 100 pieces given instead of any number of pieces, 
I figures that kinds defeated the point of the game. Score is kept for multiple words, only used
pices are replaces and the board is cleared after every round.
